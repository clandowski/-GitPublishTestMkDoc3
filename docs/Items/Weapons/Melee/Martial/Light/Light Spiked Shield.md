description: "A light shield is larger than a buckler, but instead of being carried it is strapped to the wielder’s arm. Unlike other shields a light shield does not directly interfere with spellcasting due to keeping the wielder’s hand more free to utilize (see the attached weapon feature). The spiked varient does piercing instead of bludgeoning."
