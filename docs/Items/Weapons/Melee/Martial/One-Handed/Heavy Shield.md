description: “A heavy shield is one of the larger shields, due to the size and weight it is both strapped to the wielder’s arm and requires them to hold onto, resulting in a heavy shield disallowing that hand from being used to hold other items, but also being the most difficult to disarm. (see the integrated weapon feature).”
