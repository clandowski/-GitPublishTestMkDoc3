effect: An endless potion decanter allows a creature to pour a single dose of a potion into the flask. Once in the flask the flask will continue to replicate the potion after it has been consumed. The decanter once emptied will refill itself after one hour has passed, allowing for the potion to be consumed or emptied again. Once emptied, if a new potion is input into the flask the decanter will attune to the new potion and begin producing it instead of the previous.  Decanters come in multiple tiers, which determine the rarity of potion the decanter can reproduce; the decanter will replicate any rank of potion as long as the minimum rarity it is reproducing is valid. A Tier 2 potion decanter can produce up to a maximum rarity of uncommon potions.  Non-potion liquids can be stored, but otherwise are not replicated by the decanter, and will stop the decanter from producing liquid until the foreign substance is removed.
