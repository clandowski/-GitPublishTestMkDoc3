effect: Unlike other slotless magic items, a warping quiver must be attuned to each day; though does not limit the usage of other spotless magic items. The creature may store a number of weapons equal to their Psyche modifier (minimum 2) within the quiver that are appropriately sized for them. Other creatures cannot access or store weapons within the quiver while it is attuned to a creature, though other creatures may attempt to attune to this quiver; but doing so ejects all the items stored within this quiver. This quiver automatically resizes itself to the size of the creature wearing it. Larger weapons may be stored within it, but for each size category above the attuned creature the weapon takes twice the number of slots it normally would (thus a medium sized creature would need 2 slots for a large sized weapon, and 4 slots for a huge sized weapon).  Once a weapon has spent at least an hour within the quiver it becomes bound to the quiver for 24 hours. A bound weapon thrown or shot by the wearer are immediately recalled to the quiver after the attack resolves as long as the weapon would still be unattended after the attack resolves (a weapon caught by a foe would be unable to be called back to the quiver).  Ammunition that would be destroyed after an attack resolves is still destroyed, but this may be used to recover ammunition that would not be normally destroyed after the attack resolves.
