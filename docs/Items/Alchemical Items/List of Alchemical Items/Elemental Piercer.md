effect: Each elemental piercer is keyed to a specific elemental damage type on creation. The creature impacted by this compound has its elemental Resist reduced by 1 for every 2 ranks of this item for 1 minute. If this  would reduce the creature’s Resist below 0, it gains vulnerability against that element for the duration. This has no effect against creatures who are immune to the keyed element’s effects.
