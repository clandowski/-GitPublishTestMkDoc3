Traits: "The following traits may be granted for any form:<ul><li>Beast Speed: The land speed granted by Beast Form (granting 2 legs if the creature lacked a land speed).</li><li>Scent: The creature gains the Scent universal ability. If the creature already possesses scent they instead double the effective range of the ability.</li><li>Sprint: A number of times per day equal to 1/2 BCB (minimum 1) the creature can take the run action and does not lose their Agility bonus to AC.</li><li>Darkvision: The creature gains Darkvision 30 feet; if they already possessed darkvision it instead improved by an additional 30 feet.Low-Light Vision: The creature gains low-light vision; if they already possessed low-light vision they double the distance of their low-light vision (effectively allowing them to see 4x as far)</li><li>Claws(Requires arms or front pair of at least 4 legs): The creature gains two claw attacks (1d4 medium, 1d3 small).</li><li>Gore(Requires Head): The creature gains a gore attack (1d6 medium, 1d4 small).</li><li>Beast Intelligence: The creature’s intelligence is reduced to animal intelligence of 1; the creature loses knowledge of their proficiencies and acts completely through instinct, losing access to class features provided by their non-creature classes. This adjustment to intelligence is made after other modifiers to the creature’s existing intelligence; this has no effect if the creature’s intelligence is already negative due to damage, though can prevent their intelligence from raising above this value if the intelligence would be restored without removing this effect. This cannot affect mindless creatures.</li></ul>"
