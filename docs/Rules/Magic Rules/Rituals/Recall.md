You may also bring one additional willing creature of medium size or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) per three BCB levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. Unwilling creatures or creatures with spell resistance, besides you, are subject to a will save attack against this ability.
