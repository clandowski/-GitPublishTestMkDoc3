description: The blade binder gains an enhancement bonus to all strength and Agility based skill checks, MSB, and Physical(Str) checks for all reposition or grapple combat maneuvers equal to his summoned armor’s enhancement bonus. In addition the blade binder adds half his armor’s strength rating value to all damage rolls with melee weapons; at 8th level the binder instead adds all of his armor's strength rating; this does not apply to the strength rating increases for lacking proficiency in an armor.
